This is an R package for estimating ordered regression models that allow some 
variables to have different coefficients across the outcome levels. This becomes 
necessary when the proportional odds assumption is not met.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `orderedReg` using:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jwood-iastate/orderedReg")
```
